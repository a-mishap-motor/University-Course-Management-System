# University-Course-Management-System
A course management system implemented in node/express as part of the mid-term project of the PayPal VAP.

To start, run app.js.
The app runs on localhost:5000.

The login details, courses and enrollments are stored locally in app.js, since the use of a db was not intended or required.
The session persists until a page is reloaded or a new request is made.
